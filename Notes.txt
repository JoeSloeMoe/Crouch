Crouching steadies your aim.
Currently 7DTD treats weapon handling the same whether a player is standing or crouching. This mod adds some basic
stabilisation effects that you might normaly expect to see from crouch firing.

  Added ranged weapon effects when Crouching : 
		Increases: max range 10%, Weapons Handling 13%. 
		Reduces: Spread Multiplier 15%, Kickback 5%, ADS Stamina cost reduction.

  Note: ADS 'stamina reduction' is actually INCREASING player stamina regen by 20% which in turn slows stamina loss down when ADS. 
        So the actual reduction amount will depend on any other stamina effects the player might have active as well.
